 Representation Learning for the Automatic Indexing of Sound Effects Libraries (ISMIR 2022): Deep audio embeddings pre-trained on UCS & Non-UCS-compliant datasets.
 
This work was inspired by the creation of the [Universal Category System (UCS)](https://universalcategorysystem.com), an industry-proposed public domain initiative initialized by Tim Nielsen, Justin Drury, Kai Paquin, and others. UCS offers a standardized framework for sound effects library metadata designed by and for sound designers and editors.
